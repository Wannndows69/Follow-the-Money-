# Follow the money. Receipts & no peace.

$19.3 billion committed to the Board of Peace. $1.25 billion moved out of disaster relief and peacekeeping accounts. Zero congressional votes. Zero independent audits. Zero dollars confirmed reaching Gaza.

This is the only public ledger.  



## What this is

An automated financial tracker for every pledge, transfer, and reallocation flowing through Trump's Board of Peace for Gaza. Three Python collectors scrape primary sources every 6 hours, extract dollar amounts, categorize events, and push updates to a static site on GitHub Pages. No manual entry. No editorial filtering. Just the money.

## What it tracks

**U.S. taxpayer money:** The $10B pledge (no congressional approval, no funding source identified). The $1.25B State Dept reallocation ($1B from international disaster assistance, $200M from peacekeeping, $50M from international orgs). All of it moved without a vote.

**Country membership pledges:** $1B buys a permanent seat. UAE ($2.7B), Saudi Arabia ($1B), Qatar ($1B), Kuwait ($1B). Five more countries lumped into a $7B total with no individual breakdowns. Azerbaijan disputed being included.

**Fund structure:** The World Bank's GRAD Fund operates as a "limited trustee" with no fiduciary responsibility after disbursement. JPMorgan is in talks to bank for the BoP while Trump simultaneously sues them for $5B. The Carnegie Endowment warns the whole thing "will likely devolve into Trump's private enterprise" when the UN mandate expires.

**Governance:** Executive orders, charter signatories, the 16 countries that walked away, Senate oversight letters that went unanswered, and legislative responses.

**International:** FIFA's $75M stadium deal. OCHA's $2B fundraising target. Japan's donor conference with no date and no target.

## Sources

Collectors pull from 8 monitored sources across 3 collection methods:

| Method | Source | What it watches |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| RSS | Google News | 5 query rotations: "Board of Peace" + financial keywords |
| API | Wikipedia: Board of Peace | Revision diffs for financial content changes |
| API | Wikipedia: Gaza peace plan | Same diff tracking for the broader article |
| Direct | Carnegie Endowment | New BoP analyses and policy briefs |
| Direct | Semafor | Investigative reporting on BoP financial flows |
| Direct | World Bank GRAD Fund | Content-hash change detection |
| Direct | Sen. Cortez Masto | Press releases (BoP, Gaza, LIHEAP, foreign aid) |
| Direct | Sen. Markey | Press releases (BoP, Gaza, oversight) |

Trusted sources (Reuters, AP, PBS, NPR, Semafor, Carnegie, Senate.gov, World Bank) auto-add when financial data is detected. Everything else goes to `candidates.json` for review.
